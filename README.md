# Self Assessment

### By Sean McDermott

**Self Assessment Questions**

1. Is there anything about the general job search and internship process you feel unprepared for? What would make you feel more comfortable and confident in your job search and internship interviews?

2. Is there anything about searching for and transitioning into your future career in the technical field you feel unprepared for? What would make you feel more comfortable and confident in this process?

**Self Assessment Answers**

1. Personally, I've never felt very comfortable in interviews. While I've been in the culinary industry for some time, the interview process is hardly something to worry about. With so many programmers to choose from though, I'm worried that my "stage fright" will get the best of me in an interview. Situations where I have to "perform" in front of people have always made me uneasy. It's not always a lack of preparedness either. It's just being in the spotlight in general. In order to feel as comfortable as possible, I think it would be good for me to practice interviewing a bit more in practice settings and getting my technical terminology and white-boarding skills to a place where I feel more comfortable.

2. I'm sure I'm not the only person that has "imposter syndrome" at this point. It's a bit frightening to transition from the service industry into the tech industry. While some of my teamwork, communication and problem solving abilities will certainly transfer over, I still feel unprepared in many ways. Once again, I feel like I mostly need to work on interview prep to feel as comfortable as possible moving forward.

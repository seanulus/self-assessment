# Self Assessment

### By Sean McDermott

**Self Assessment Questions**

1. Is there anything about the general job search and internship process you feel unprepared for? What would make you feel more comfortable and confident in your job search and internship interviews?

2. Is there anything about searching for and transitioning into your future career in the technical field you feel unprepared for? What would make you feel more comfortable and confident in this process?

**Self Assessment Answers**

1. Personally, I've never felt very comfortable in interviews. While I've been in the culinary industry for some time, the interview process is hardly something to worry about. With so many programmers to choose from though, I'm worried that my "stage fright" will get the best of me in an interview. Situations where I have to "perform" in front of people have always made me uneasy. It's not always a lack of preparedness either. It's just being in the spotlight in general. In order to feel as comfortable as possible, I think it would be good for me to practice interviewing a bit more in practice settings and getting my technical terminology and white-boarding skills to a place where I feel more comfortable.

2. I'm sure I'm not the only person that has "imposter syndrome" at this point. It's a bit frightening to transition from the service industry into the tech industry. While some of my teamwork, communication and problem solving abilities will certainly transfer over, I still feel unprepared in many ways. Once again, I feel like I mostly need to work on interview prep to feel as comfortable as possible moving forward.

### Plan

**My Plan Will Be As Follows**

* Use some time today to finish cover letters and LinkedIn features I didn't finish yesterday.
(finished LinkedIn)(cover letter finished)

* Use time today to go through technical interview questions and come up with thorough and accurate answers to individual questions as a resource/study guide.

* Go through some lessons on Udemy to get a start on React.js and start learning some of the basic concepts.

* Practice some white-boarding questions to get more comfortable handling the process and understand how to talk my way through a problem.

### Technical Interview Questions

* What is a framework, and why use it?

A framework is a collection of programs brought together to accomplish a task, make coding more efficient and generally make the lives of coders easier.

* Name every database association relationship.

One-to-one: Both tables can have only one record on either side of the relationship.

One-to-many: The primary key table contains only one record that relates to none, one, or many records in the related table.

Many-to-many: Each record in both tables can relate to any number of records (or no records) in the other table.

* What is an ORM?

ORM stands for Object-Relational Mapping. It is a technique that lets you query and manipulate data from a database using an object-oriented paradigm.

* What is a migration?

Migration is the process of moving from the use of one operating environment to another. This can involve upgrading to new hardware and/or software.

* What is a route?

A route is a "pathway" used to determine which "page" is being viewed by the user. While react doesn't use multiple pages, it gives the user the illusion by routing to different components/properties to display different information.

* What is the difference between a POST and GET request?

A GET request is generally used to retrieve information without changing it. A POST request is usually changing something about the requested information such as changing a password.

* What is Git and why would you use it?

Git is a version control system that allows you to keep track of multiple versions of your projects. This gives you a great advantage because it allows for you access to all previous versions of your code. If you happen to break something along the way, you can go back to a previous version instead of having to start all over from the beginning.

* Which JavaScript frameworks do you have experience with? What are the strengths of those frameworks?

I have experience with Angular and React. Angular is an object oriented framework as where React is a functionally based library. They are both great tools for programmers. Angular allows you to route and pass information through components very easily as well as offering service injection. These are all tools that save a massive amount of time for programmers. React is usable with other JavaScript frameworks and will easily adapt to those circumstances. It's also incredibly fast. The code is much more simple and has fewer bugs in general.

* What happens when a user logs into a website?

* What is a class?

A class is an ES6 JavaScript object that contains a constructor and any methods attached to that class. It is used for creating objects.

* What is an object?

An object can be anything in and object-oriented language such as JavaScript. From strings, arrays, numbers and so on, everything in an object-oriented language is considered an object.

* What is a module? How does it differ from a class?

A module is essentially a library of methods. The difference between a module and a class is that a class can be instantiated and a module cannot. It will only ever be a library of methods. You can however attach these methods to a class.

* Why use a module?

Modules are not always necessary applications, however when you have multiple components/controllers, they can come in handy when you have a few methods you'd like to attach to each of them without having to rewrite the methods every time.

* Give an example of recursion

A factorial problem is a good example of recursion. The function calls itself in order to go through each number leading to the base case. Recursion is sometimes a good practice but can lead to slow runtimes and infinite loops if you're not careful.

* What is unit testing?

It is a level of software testing where individual units/components of a software are tested. The purpose is to validate that each unit of the software performs as designed. It is the smallest testable part of any software.

* What is integration testing?

Integration Testing is a level of software testing where individual units are combined and tested as a group. The purpose of this level of testing is to expose faults in the interaction between integrated units.

* What happens when a user types in a URL?

First, the browser checks the caches for the browser, operating system, router and finally the internet service provider. If the URL is not cached then the ISP's DNS server initiates a DNS query to find the IP address of the server that hosts the searched website.

* What is string interpolation?

String interpolation in ES6 is known as template literals. It allows you to use variable values in strings using the correct syntax. In JavaScript this is `String of words ${variable}`.

* How do local and instance variables differ?

Scope: Local variables are visible only in the method or block they are declared whereas instance variables can been seen by all methods in the class.

Place where they are declared: Local variables are declared inside a method or a block whereas instance variables inside a class but outside a method.

Existence time: Local variables are created when a method is called and destroyed when the method exits whereas instance variables are created using new and destroyed by the garbage collector when there are no reference to them.

Access: You can't access local variables whereas instance variables can be accessed if they are declared as public.

Where they are declared: Local variables are declared in a method or a block before they are called, whereas instance variables can be declared anywhere in the class level (even after their use).

Instance variables always have a value even if they're not assigned one. Local variables without a value will give you an error.

* What is a foreign key?

A foreign key is a column or group of columns in a relational database table that provides a link between data in two tables. It acts as a cross-reference between tables because it references the primary key of another table, thereby establishing a link between them.

* What is REST?

REpresentational State Transfer is an architectural style for providing standards between computer systems on the web, making it easier for systems to communicate with each other. REST-compliant or RESTful systems are characterized by how they are stateless and separate the concerns of client and server.
